        <p> The most common cause of death are gunshots for all social group based on race/ethnicity with more than 400 records. It is relatively huge compared to the other cause of death. unclear US gun policy which allows individuals to carry gun in public without any certificate could become one of the main reason of the high police killing cases that happen in USA. Moreover, death by Taser are more likely to happen to Black Americans. </p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Throughout the dashboard we can see that White Americans with age ranging from 28 to 40 are mostly killed across USA followed by Black Americans. Based on the states, California is the states with most police killing cases where Alaska and Maine accounts for the states with lowest police killing cases. Race and Ethnicity is not the only factor that contribute to police killing but There are also other factor such as age, gender, and whether they are armed or not that could increase the rate of  police killings.
